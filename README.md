## Not sure how you ended up here, but welcome

I am a Physics graduate student studying EPR spectroscopy and my code definitely reflects that.

I hope to add more as my PhD progresses, but for now there isn't much here.

A bit about me:
* Vim-using amateur programming enthusiast
* \\thread

## My repos 

### Useful [EPR code](https://github.com/brad-ley/misc-useful), including plot_gui (in Python) that allows drag-and-drop plotting for a variety of column-vector data files. [plot_gui](https://github.com/brad-ley/misc-useful/blob/master/plot_gui_v3.py) functionality also includes:
* Log-linear or log-log plotting on either axis
* x-axis limit setting
* .csv export and matplotlib .csv import and .png formatting for professional export
* Independent axis and any or all dependent axis data selection
* Multiple window plotting functionality, as well as stacking plots from different files in same window

There are also .py files for reformatting rephased .dat files from the EPR spectrometer into absorption and dispersion file groups that may be plot using [plot_gui](https://github.com/brad-ley/misc-useful/blob/master/plot_gui_v3.py) or [stack_plot](https://github.com/brad-ley/misc-useful/blob/master/stack_plot.py) as well as a script that extracts peak-to-peak linewidth (in Gauss) as a function of temperature and reformats it for plotting, in either [plot_gui](https://github.com/brad-ley/misc-useful/blob/master/plot_gui_v3.py) or [plot_p2p](https://github.com/brad-ley/misc-useful/blob/master/plot_p2p.py).

### My only other public repo (currently) is used for [zero-field-split powder-pattern](https://github.com/brad-ley/matlab-zfs/blob/master/gd_csc.m) generation over a range of spin-coupled radii.

## Pull requests 

Feel free to make one, any and all additions are welcome (as long as they are constructive and don't remove any functionality)!
