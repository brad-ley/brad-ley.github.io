## Not sure how you ended up here, but welcome

I am a Physics graduate student studying EPR spectroscopy and my code definitely reflects that.

I hope to add more as my PhD progresses, but for now there isn't much here.

A bit about me:
* Amateur programming enthusiast
* Big fan of the Canucks, Blue Jays, and Raptors
* \\thread

## My repos 

### Useful [EPR code](https://github.com/brad-ley/misc-useful), including [plotGUI](https://github.com/brad-ley/misc-useful/blob/master/plotGUI.py) (in Python) that allows drag-and-drop plotting for a variety of column-vector data files. [plotGUI](https://github.com/brad-ley/misc-useful/blob/master/plotGUI.py) functionality also includes:
* Log-linear or log-log plotting on either axis
* x-axis limit setting
* .csv export and matplotlib .csv import and .png formatting for professional export
* Independent axis and any or all dependent axis data selection
* Multiple window plotting functionality, as well as stacking plots from different files in same window

There are also [.py files](https://github.com/brad-ley/misc-useful/blob/master/overlay_newfile.py) for reformatting rephased .dat files from the EPR spectrometer into absorption and dispersion file groups that may be plot using [plotGUI](https://github.com/brad-ley/misc-useful/blob/master/plotGUI.py) or [stack_plot](https://github.com/brad-ley/misc-useful/blob/master/stack_plot.py), as well as a script that extracts peak-to-peak linewidth (in Gauss) as a function of temperature and reformats it for plotting.

### My only other public repo (currently) is used for [zero-field-split powder-pattern](https://github.com/brad-ley/matlab-zfs/blob/master/gd_csc.m) generation over a range of spin-coupled radii.

## Pull requests 

Feel free to make one, any and all additions are welcome (as long as they are constructive and don't remove any functionality)!
